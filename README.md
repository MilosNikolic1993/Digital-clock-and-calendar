Digital clock and calendar

This Python program creates a real-time digital clock and calendar using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface, time.strftime for formatting the current time (HH:MM:SS AM/PM),
and datetime.datetime.now for displaying the current date, with continuous updates achieved using tkinterâ€™s after method to refresh the clock every second, while the GUI remains interactive through root.mainloop().
